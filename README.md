# Fotograsp

Review latest Unsplash collections on [Fotograsp - live DEMO](https://fotograsp.netlify.com/) (limited to 50 requests per hour)

## Mock-up

[Fotograsp - MOCK-UP](https://fotograsp-mock.netlify.com/)

Review mock-up Unsplash collections by using link above.
During development Unsplash limits its API requests to 50 per hour, which might cause some troubles with data loading.
Mock-up contains sample server responses to show the functionality of the site.

Note: Mockup will load the details info about only one of 10 sample photos (chosen randomly from collections).

## Installation

```bash
npm i
```

## Run development server

```bash
npm run start
```

## Run build

```bash
npm run build
```

## Mock data

Branch **mock** uses sample response data for mocking the original Unsplash API.
